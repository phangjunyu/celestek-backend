# Celestek Beacon
Beacon analyzes multiple landscape parameters including: 

Crop type, fertility, patterns, surface area, wind conditions, and roadside obstacles to determine the safest off-airport landing spots for pilots. A continuously updated map ranks ideal landing sites using infrared reflection to analyze surface conditions with machine learning algorithms. Beacon aims to equip every pilot with a backup option in a far-from-airfield emergency scenario.
